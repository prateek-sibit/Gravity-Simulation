It was a morning physics lecture on mechanics and the topic for the day was rotational motion and its aspects in context to astronomical study and planetary motion. It was after we had analyzed the study of 2 bodies under a mutual force of gravitation that my Professor told us about the complexity involved for extending this idea to three bodies. It was then that he suggested that it would be a good idea for some student to try and recreate a three body simulation as no analytical solution existed.
Merely this thought that even the greatest minds of physics could not come up with an analytical solution and yet it was possible numerically struck my mind. Upon thinking on this fact I found that the greatest machine for numerical computation was one that we all use everyday , the Computer. Upon researching further on the mathematics involved and the computational power required I decided to take up this problem as my computer science project.
