The three body problem is a mechanics problem of taking an initial set of data that specifies the positions, velocities and masses of three bodies for some specific points in space and time and then determining and studying the trajectories of those bodies ,in accordance with newton’s laws of motion (classical mechanics)
The three body problem is essential nothing but a special case of the n-body problem.
Historically it is seen that the first 3 body problem to have undergone an extensive study was that of the Earth Sun and the moon.
In 1883 two mathematicians namely Heinrich Bruns and Henri Poincare showed that there exissts no general analytical solution for the three-body problem given by an algebraic expression or integrals.
